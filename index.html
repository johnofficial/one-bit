        <p><strong>One Bit Animation </strong>is company which make <strong>3D Animation </strong>. So, the beginning. I initially created this website as a small and fun project. It was nothing serious, I barely knew how to create a site, let alone do everything else, but I love to learn by doing, rather than studying books and texts. So that's what I did. I created a site and I wanted some unique content, but I didn't want to write large articles, I had already done that on other projects.</p>
